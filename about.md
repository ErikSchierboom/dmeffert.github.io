I’m a software developer from Nijmegen, The Netherlands. &nbsp; My focus is mainly on the web and mobile apps, but I also like to do some occasional game development. &nbsp; I graduated from the [Radboud University](http://cs.ru.nl/) with a MSc in Computer Science.

Currently my favorite programming languages are C# and F#, but I also like to dabble in JavaScript and I have done many PHP projects for clients and previous employers. &nbsp; I’m available to work on programming projects as a freelancer.
